# Global Inequalities In Geopolitcs
Data analysis on spatial inequalities within the academic field of Geopolitics.

This quantitative analysis will analyse and report on the spatial component to knowledge production in geopolitics.
This will show to what extent knowledge production is stratified in the field, and provide some preliminary answers that might explain why knowledge production
is being confined to the Global North. To categorise the spatial component it will use the G77+China model to define the division between the Global North and 
Global South. An additional decision was made to include Mexico in the Global South model. 

It is not possible to identify a specific source for the knowledge used in geopolitical analysis, since this will vary amongst author, discipline, and object of study.
It is possible, however, to provide a sample of sources that might indicate wider trends. To this end, this analysis pulled data from the peer-reviewed Scopus database
for every identifiable article from six academic journals that include geopolitical insights: Antipode, Dialogues in Human Geography, Geoforum, Geopolitics, Political
Geography, and Progress in Human Geography. This produced exactly 11,000 individual articles. The data for these articles was then trimmed to include the following 
information: title of publication, author, year of publication, number of citations in other publications, funding sponsor (if any), affiliate institution,
and affiliate country (the country the institution resided). To go further, this analysis include manually collected data that samples the references for 12
journal articles. These were taken from recent publications of Antipode, Geopolitics, and Political Geography. The same information, bar the funding sponsor, 
was collected.  The methodology of ‘authorship mapping’ that follows replicates the studies done by the team working on projects at ‘The Knowledge G.A.P,’ who 
have analysed data from the same source to understand the inequalities present in development studies (Goudarzi 2022).

Limits of the data: the main limit to the data is that it does not take into account multi-author papers. Instead, it takes the first author and their affiliate institution.
